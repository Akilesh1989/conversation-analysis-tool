Technical Implementation Details:

Model Architecture:
- Implemented Sentence Transformers for advanced semantic understanding of text, replacing traditional sentence processing methods
- Utilized XGBoost as the primary classification model due to superior accuracy metrics compared to other evaluated models
- Reference implementation of alternative models available at: sentiment_analysis/training_with_multiple_models.py

Future Enhancements:
1. Text Processing Optimization
   - Evaluate performance of simplified text transformation techniques
   - Benchmark against current Sentence Transformer implementation

2. Model Improvements 
   - Experiment with additional open-source sentence transformer models
   - Implement deep learning frameworks for comparison
   - Assess performance using OpenAI embeddings
