3,Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.,Curious to dive deeper
3,i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life,Neutral
3,Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex.,Neutral
3," thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced",Neutral
3,Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it.,Surprised
3,say what now?? they have that??,Surprised
3,Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!,Happy
3,thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!,Surprised
3,Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,Surprised
3,i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?,Neutral
3,That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.,Surprised
3,i guess they live up to their name then!,Surprised
3,It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.,Surprised
3,thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis?,Neutral
3,Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth's.,Curious to dive deeper

4,Hi!  do you like to dance?,Neutral
4,I love to dance a lot. How about you?,Happy
4," I am really bad, but it is a good time.",Neutral
4,Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?,Happy
4," I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything!",Surprised
4,Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.,Surprised
4,I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!,Neutral
4,Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?,Curious to dive deeper
4," Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.",Neutral

4,That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them.,Surprised
4,No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this.,Neutral
4," It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.",Neutral
4,Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye,Happy
4,Bye,Neutral

5,Yes and did get used so that is good. Nice chat,Happy
6," hi, do you use google much?",Curious to dive deeper
6," Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?",Curious to dive deeper
6,Yes. a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon,Surprised
6,And before on Google moon they used to use cheese for close ups!,Surprised
6,do you know how google maps calculates traffic?,Surprised
6," I am not sure, how do they do this?",Curious to dive deeper
6,they track how fast android devices are moving,Curious to dive deeper
6,Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity.,Surprised
6,Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years,Curious to dive deeper
6,But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?,Curious to dive deeper
6,No I have. What does the results turn?,Curious to dive deeper
6,You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?,Curious to dive deeper
6," Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though",Curious to dive deeper
6," Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun.",Surprised
6,I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield,Curious to dive deeper
6," Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.",Happy
6,Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them,Curious to dive deeper
6,That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.,Surprised
6,wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat,Surprised
6," That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years.",Surprised
6,They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
7,Do you like comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I do like comic books!,Happy
7,Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?,Curious to dive deeper
7," I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with ""excelsior!""",Happy
7,I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas.,Happy
7,I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.,Curious to dive deeper
7,The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!,Happy
7,That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?,Curious to dive deeper
7," I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!",Happy
7," That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. ",Curious to dive deeper
7," I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!",Happy
7," That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them. ",Curious to dive deeper
7,No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.,Curious to dive deeper
7,That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets.,Happy
7,That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
7,It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!,Happy
7,I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!,Curious to dive deeper
7,Hahah That's a good way of putting it!,Happy
7," Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
8,Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse.,Surprised
8,Its amazing and ever evolving.,Surprised
8,Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away.,Surprised
8,They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see,Neutral
8," Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. ",Surprised
8,I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
8," Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...",Surprised
8,There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron?,Curious to dive deeper
8," Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  ",Surprised
8,It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.,Disgusted
8,Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?,Curious to dive deeper
8," I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.",Neutral
8," Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. ",Happy
8,Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.,Curious to dive deeper
8,On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.,Curious to dive deeper
8," I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  ",Surprised
8," Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. ",Neutral
8," I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. ",Happy
9,Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what's going on.,Curious to dive deeper
9," Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!",Happy
9," Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.",Curious to dive deeper
9," Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.",Surprised
9,$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.,Neutral
9," Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!",Surprised
9,A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.,Neutral
9," Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!",Neutral
9," I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.",Curious to dive deeper
9,Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious!,Surprised
9,I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!,Curious to dive deeper
9,I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!,Neutral
9,I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.,Curious to dive deeper
9," That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. ",Curious to dive deeper
9," I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. ",Curious to dive deeper
9," Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!",Neutral
9," Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.",Neutral
9," Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!",Neutral
9," I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.",Happy
9," Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!",Happy
9," Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.",Happy
10," Naming a cloned cat ""copy cat"", that's cute.",Neutral
10,You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.,Sad
10,Really? That's awful to hear!,Surprised
10,Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!,Surprised
10," Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover.",Surprised
10," And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets ""OWNER"" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  ",Surprised
10,I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.,Curious to dive deeper
10,Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?,Surprised
10,That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.",Surprised
10,I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?",Surprised
10," Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.",Curious to dive deeper
10,Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.",Happy
10," Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?",Surprised
10,I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!,Surprised
10,That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!,Curious to dive deeper
10,Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.,Curious to dive deeper
10,I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?,Curious to dive deeper
10," That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog",Curious to dive deeper
10,Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.,Neutral
10," Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.",Curious to dive deeper
10,Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...,Curious to dive deeper
10,Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.,Curious to dive deeper
10,That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.",Curious to dive deeper
10,One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?,Neutral
10,Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.,Curious to dive deeper
10,Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!,Surprised
10,It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
11,I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section.,Sad
11,That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat.,Surprised
11," Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future.",Surprised
11,Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile.,Surprised
11,Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.,Surprised
11," Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.",Neutral
11," I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance.",Curious to dive deeper
11,Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.,Surprised
11,Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.,Surprised
11," That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!",Disgusted
11," Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish.",Surprised
11," Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15.",Surprised
11," Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena",Curious to dive deeper
11,Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.,Surprised
11," I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian.",Surprised
11," Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Surprised
11,The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions,Surprised
11,That's funny. It's not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.,Surprised
11,Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members,Curious to dive deeper
11," That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy",Neutral
11,DNA matches could be connected via social media.,Surprised
12," hi, do you like fish?",Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, I love fish do you?",Neutral
12,yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?",Neutral
12," that is so cool, and the males carry the young in that species",Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.",Neutral
12,yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?",Neutral
12,that is cool. there is a jellyfish that is immortal,Curious to dive deeper
12," I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?",Neutral
12," that is a such a cool fact, we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away",Curious to dive deeper
12," lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species.",Neutral
12,yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence,Curious to dive deeper
12," I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.",Neutral
12,do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth?,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, 20 quintillion, can you believe that?Wow",Surprised
12,I do not even know how many zeros are in that number,Curious to dive deeper
12," lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.",Surprised
12,and Roosevelet did not have any of them,Curious to dive deeper
12,He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.,Neutral
12,I like that too. nice chat,Happy
13,Hello,Happy
13,Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them.,Neutral
13," No, I do not.  I am actually allergic to cats.  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat",Surprised
13," That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?",Neutral
13," Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.",Sad
13,Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets?,Surprised
13," Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats",Curious to dive deeper
13,I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.,Neutral
13,Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future.,Curious to dive deeper
13,Do you have any now?  I have two.,Curious to dive deeper
13," No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish",Surprised
13,I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes.,Curious to dive deeper
13,I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That's a great question.,Curious to dive deeper
13,Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is.,Curious to dive deeper
13," No, I didn't.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal",Curious to dive deeper
13,Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun?,Surprised
13," Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.",Curious to dive deeper
13,And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!,Happy
13," Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Curious to dive deeper
13,I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges.,Happy
13,Me too. Thanks for the informative chat.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species?",Curious to dive deeper
14," No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff.",Surprised
14," Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight.",Curious to dive deeper
14,I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet.,Surprised
14," Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish. ",Curious to dive deeper
14," I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that.",Surprised
14,Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today.",Surprised
14,I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.,Curious to dive deeper
14," While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?",Surprised
14,Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin.",Curious to dive deeper
14," If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish. ",Curious to dive deeper
14,I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?,Surprised
14," If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny.",Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.",Neutral
14,Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?",Neutral
14," Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? ",Curious to dive deeper
14," Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?",Neutral
14,Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.",Curious to dive deeper
14,You as well!!,Curious to dive deeper
14,Thanks.,Happy
15," hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was?",Curious to dive deeper
15," Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!",Curious to dive deeper
15," haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia",Surprised
15," Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?",Curious to dive deeper
15," no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag?",Curious to dive deeper
15,I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico.,Sad
15," ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen",Curious to dive deeper
15," They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?",Happy
15," no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such",Curious to dive deeper
15," In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.",Surprised
15," hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, ""Guardians"" haha",Surprised
15," Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. ",Sad
15," ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha",Curious to dive deeper
15,Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.,Sad
15," haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it",Happy
15,Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.,Curious to dive deeper
15,I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck,Curious to dive deeper
15,So seahorses are salt water right? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin.,Surprised
15," yes that would be true, also true is that 84% of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish, we need to study that fish too!",Surprised
15,How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species!,Surprised
15," haha I wish it were real! that's funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?",Surprised
16,What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag?,Curious to dive deeper
16," I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, ""Gimme back my child"" look!",Happy
16," LOL yep you don't want to be around an angry tiger mom haha. I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is",Surprised
16,Was it a smuggling thing?,Curious to dive deeper
16,Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately,Sad
16," With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?",Happy
16," Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads?",Curious to dive deeper
16," Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do.",Happy
16,Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002,Surprised
16," I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, ""12 angry hamsters""",Happy
16," Well I'll have to watch that movie. I just think it's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL",Surprised
16,Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda.,Happy
16," It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the ""protection of animals act"". hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it",Surprised
16," Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. ",Happy
16,That is crazy! I also think it's crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal,Surprised
16," Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease...",Happy
16," Haha I haven't seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha",Surprised
16," Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?",Happy
16,Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL. Do you have any pets by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
16," Too many to count. We've had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...",Happy
16," Haha that's a lot of animals! We have a dog actually, but I can't believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia, a lot of people must have illegal pets here",Surprised
17,Can you recommend any movies to watch?,Curious to dive deeper
17,Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.,Curious to dive deeper
17,Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?,Neutral
17," Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ?",Curious to dive deeper
17,Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role,Neutral
17," He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. ",Neutral
17,Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?,Neutral
17," Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. ",Neutral
17,I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend,Happy
17,In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.,Neutral
17,Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of,Surprised
17," I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. ",Neutral
17,I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled.,Curious to dive deeper
17,Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ?,Neutral
17,I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie,Curious to dive deeper
17," They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. ",Neutral
17,Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things,Neutral
17,There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog.,Neutral
17,I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day,Neutral
17," Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.",Neutral
17,Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing,Happy
18,Good Morning! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
18," Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump.",Curious to dive deeper
18,I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago!,Curious to dive deeper
18," I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference,",Surprised
18,A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease!,Curious to dive deeper
18," People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such.",Sad
18,I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?,Curious to dive deeper
18," I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.",Curious to dive deeper
18,Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh?,Curious to dive deeper
18," There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view.",Curious to dive deeper
18,I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha.,Curious to dive deeper
18," That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more.",Happy
18," All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too.....",Curious to dive deeper
18," Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general? ",Curious to dive deeper
18," I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
18," Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.",Neutral
18,It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too?,Curious to dive deeper
18," I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.",Happy
18,Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!,Curious to dive deeper
18,Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.,Happy
18," Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!",Curious to dive deeper
19,Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions!,Curious to dive deeper
19,I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.,Neutral
19," Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment.",Curious to dive deeper
19,I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.,Surprised
19," Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!",Surprised
19,Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.,Surprised
19,Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!,Happy
19,That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order?,Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!,Curious to dive deeper
19,That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.,Surprised
19,Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance.,Curious to dive deeper
19," I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper?",Curious to dive deeper
19,I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.,Surprised
19,Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas.,Curious to dive deeper
19,Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert.,Happy
19,That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?,Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh yeah you're right. He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie!,Surprised
19,Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don't know how I missed it initially.,Surprised
19,Good point. I didn't know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today!,Curious to dive deeper
19,I didn't know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well.,Surprised
19,Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!,Happy
20,did you see that Kanye is having another kid?,Neutral
20,I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :),Neutral
20,I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that!,Curious to dive deeper
20," ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...",Curious to dive deeper
20," Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.",Curious to dive deeper
20,ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ?,Curious to dive deeper
20," Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though.",Surprised
20,I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world...,Curious to dive deeper
20," I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)",Neutral
20," lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;)",Curious to dive deeper
20,I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.,Surprised
20,Doesn't music needs melody ? ;),Surprised
20,Lots of rap does have that!,Disgusted
20,a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;),Surprised
20,I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then,Surprised
20," Maybe You're right, I don't want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I'm more of a blues fan. Classic rock, maybe metal. ;)",Curious to dive deeper
20,I'll pretty much listen to anything except country.  It is god awful,Curious to dive deeper
20,I don't listen to country but I don't mind it. It has it's own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country...,Curious to dive deeper
20,I suppose.  Just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage,Disgusted
20,I agree... I mean I haven't heard anything new that's good. Maybe except Black Country Communion... great band,Curious to dive deeper
20,Can't say I know them!,Surprised
21,Do you like rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
21," I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant.",Curious to dive deeper
21," I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. ",Curious to dive deeper
21," I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style.",Curious to dive deeper
21," That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist?",Curious to dive deeper
21," Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie.",Curious to dive deeper
21,I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?,Curious to dive deeper
21," The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler.",Curious to dive deeper
21," Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons?",Curious to dive deeper
21," I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors.",Neutral
21,That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins.,Curious to dive deeper
21," They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.",Neutral
21,Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin.,Curious to dive deeper
21,That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities.,Neutral
21,Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident.,Curious to dive deeper
21," I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap.",Disgusted
21," Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. ",Curious to dive deeper
21," Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye's middle name, Omari,. ",Neutral
21,So his initials are K.O.W. That's funny!,Curious to dive deeper
21," I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump. The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
21,Yes it was hilarious!,Curious to dive deeper
21," Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day.",Neutral
21," I enjoyed it, I hope you have a nice day as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
22,Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?,Neutral
22," haha yeah, I heard about that. It's been there since 1968.",Happy
22,I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania.,Neutral
22,What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey?,Curious to dive deeper
22," They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!",Neutral
22," Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993.",Surprised
22,I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor.,Neutral
22," They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.",Happy
22,Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked.,Neutral
22," Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards",Happy
22,I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!,Neutral
22," Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913.",Curious to dive deeper
22,Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,Neutral
22,I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years.,Neutral
22,Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.,Neutral
22,We should just have people voted in by lottery. That's what Athens used to do.,Disgusted
22,It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots.,Neutral
22," Yeah, hopefully we'll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.",Neutral
22,Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?,Neutral
22," nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.",Happy
22,That is amazing and very determined.  It's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!,Neutral
23,Hi are you a fan of Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
23," My son is, so I know a little bit about it.",Neutral
23,Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it.,Curious to dive deeper
23," No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.",Curious to dive deeper
23,There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!,Happy
23,20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights?,Curious to dive deeper
23,Didn't George Lucas get them somehow?,Curious to dive deeper
23," Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas. ",Curious to dive deeper
23,Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!,Happy
23," 20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet.",Curious to dive deeper
23,You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!,Happy
23," I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.",Neutral
23,Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes.,Happy
23," It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?",Neutral
23,Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie.,Happy
23," Sorry, what I meant was ""she won the award"". About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair.",Curious to dive deeper
23,Wow.  That sure doesn't.  I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader?  On a different subject....did you know that Earth's surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land?,Curious to dive deeper
23,I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!,Neutral
23,On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?,Happy
23,I heard about it and we need to do something about it.,Curious to dive deeper
23,I agree.  It's sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!,Happy
23,I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night.,Happy
24,Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline.,Happy
24,Hello! I do like Star Wars! I can't believe companies thought it would be a flop!,Surprised
24,Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion.,Surprised
24," I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!",Curious to dive deeper
24,Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?,Curious to dive deeper
24,Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?,Surprised
24,Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director.,Happy
24,I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not!,Curious to dive deeper
24,Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor.,Surprised
24,I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music!,Curious to dive deeper
24," That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics.",Surprised
24," Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome?",Curious to dive deeper
24,Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago!,Surprised
24,I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth's days be like 40 hours haha.,Curious to dive deeper
24,Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us!,Curious to dive deeper
24," I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way!",Curious to dive deeper
24,Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed.,Sad
24,That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!,Curious to dive deeper
24," Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!",Neutral
24," I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
24,You as well. Goodbye now!,Neutral
25," Hello, How are you? Do you like politics?",Curious to dive deeper
25," Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile.",Neutral
25," lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?",Surprised
25,I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates.,Neutral
25,I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?,Surprised
25," yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican",Neutral
25," Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!",Happy
25," They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election",Neutral
25,Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!,Happy
25," I know, id be skipping out on that election.",Neutral
25,I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display.,Curious to dive deeper
25," Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history.",Neutral
25,Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans!,Curious to dive deeper
25,It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too.,Neutral
25," Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol",Happy
25,Keep them working.  LOL,Neutral
25," Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped!  It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor. ",Surprised
25," I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort.",Neutral
25,I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!,Neutral
25,For real!  Have a good one!,Neutral
25,You too! Have a good night!!,Happy
26,Do you know much about politics?,Curious to dive deeper
26,Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the 'candy desk' tradition is about?,Curious to dive deeper
26," I've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time?",Surprised
26," What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. ",Surprised
26," Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. ",Surprised
26," That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan's political dealings?",Curious to dive deeper
26,I don't. Tell me more.,Curious to dive deeper
26," He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. ",Happy
26," Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections.",Surprised
26,Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.,Neutral
26,The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That's actually more than I would guess.,Surprised
26," Well, we'll see how voting will be done twenty years from now, if they make it easier, the numbers will probably rise. ",Curious to dive deeper
26,That's true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918.,Surprised
26,I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918.,Curious to dive deeper
26," I'm sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. ",Surprised
26,That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted?,Curious to dive deeper
26,I don't. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993.,Surprised
26,I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it's wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections.,Curious to dive deeper
26,Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter.,Surprised
26,I think I've read that before! Wild to think about.,Curious to dive deeper
26,Nice chatting with you. Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
27," Hey how are you, can't believe that Georgia senator got arrested!",Curious to dive deeper
27,She said she was peacefully chanting.,Sad
27," That's interesting, I wish voting was different now, no reason to still have ballots with no federal holiday for Election Day.",Curious to dive deeper
27,It's interesting that astronauts vote from space!,Surprised
27," For sure, I wonder if it's confidential up there? How does it get back to earth?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter.",Surprised
27," I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Yes I did. And even though we don't have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years.",Surprised
27," That's crazy, I wonder if they'll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it. ",Curious to dive deeper
27,Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence!,Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4"", I should run for president lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
27," Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.",Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again?",Curious to dive deeper
27,It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people.,Surprised
27," Ah I gotcha, they're kind of right I'm sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits.",Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they'd be around forever too.",Curious to dive deeper
27," I think it's interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha.",Surprised
27," For sure, I wonder why people don't show up so much, I wish they would more!",Curious to dive deeper
27," Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.",Surprised
27," Very cool. Great chatting with you, I'm going to take off though, take care!",Curious to dive deeper
28,did you watch the movie Frozen?,Curious to dive deeper
28," I did and loved it so much, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
28,me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing",Curious to dive deeper
28,I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad",Curious to dive deeper
28,That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yeah. DO you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
28,I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
28,I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and there are blood drives for dogs,Curious to dive deeper
28,So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved,Curious to dive deeper
28,I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and same goes for the elephants as well,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yeah. Google is a dog company it seems,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes they have that in their code of conduct, talk about dedication",Curious to dive deeper
28," I know right, dogs deserve that though",Curious to dive deeper
29,Do you like baseball ?,Curious to dive deeper
29,I have heard of it. Do you?,Neutral
29," I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don't watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. ",Surprised
29," That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work.",Neutral
29," Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  ",Neutral
29," Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure.",Neutral
29," I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ? ",Curious to dive deeper
29," I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. ",Neutral
29," I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. ",Neutral
29," Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. ",Neutral
29," Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   ",Neutral
29,Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.,Neutral
29," Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. ",Neutral
29," Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands.",Neutral
29," As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?",Curious to dive deeper
29,I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
29," Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. ",Sad
29,Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV.,Neutral
29," Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.",Neutral
29,It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games?,Curious to dive deeper
29," There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. ",Neutral
29," The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!",Happy
29," You too, have a good evening.",Neutral
30,Hi there are you a baseball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
30,i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?,Neutral
30,I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed.,Happy
30,I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager.,Neutral
30,I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time.,Happy
30," yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.",Neutral
30,Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing.,Happy
30," Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.",Neutral
30,Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot.,Happy
30," Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?",Neutral
30,I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol,Happy
30," Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?",Neutral
30,I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!,Happy
30,Really? the womens game? do men play as well?,Neutral
30," lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!",Happy
30," Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.",Neutral
30,No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.,Happy
30,He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball.,Neutral
30,Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting!,Happy
30," Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!",Neutral
30,You have a great weekend too!,Happy
31," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?",Neutral
31,Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?,Curious to dive deeper
31," I haven't seen it. Is it a good film? It's animated, right? With lots of songs?",Curious to dive deeper
31," Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen",Curious to dive deeper
31,HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards?,Curious to dive deeper
31," I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character",Surprised
31,that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?,Neutral
31," There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.",Surprised
31,Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent.,Neutral
31,I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set,Surprised
31," Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well.",Neutral
31,Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves,Curious to dive deeper
31," A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.",Neutral
31," Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist",Curious to dive deeper
31,I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice.,Neutral
31,I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash?,Surprised
31,The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward.,Neutral
31,Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!,Happy
31,Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!,Neutral
31,I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha,Happy
31,Have a good night,Neutral
31," Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they're not actually colorblind but they just don't see as many colors as a normal human can",Surprised
32," Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught.",Sad
32," Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter",Sad
32," Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws.",Sad
32," Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult",Sad
32," Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members.",Sad
32," It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that",Sad
32,You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid.,Sad
32,I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school,Happy
32," Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation.",Sad
32," Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie",Sad
32," Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety.",Sad
32,I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago!,Surprised
32,I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?,Sad
32,Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes!,Surprised
32," Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.",Happy
32," yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait!",Happy
32," Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn't know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!!",Surprised
32," Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can't remember...",Curious to dive deeper
32," Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.",Surprised
32," Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to ""de-feminize"" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/",Neutral
32," hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!",Happy
32,Have a lovely day as well :),Neutral
33," Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of ""Frozen"" the movie? I personally Looooved it!",Curious to dive deeper
33,I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?,Neutral
33," both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars",Curious to dive deeper
33," That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?",Neutral
33," That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?",Curious to dive deeper
33,I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?,Neutral
33," Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch?",Curious to dive deeper
33," I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.",Neutral
33," Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown",Curious to dive deeper
33," I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.",Neutral
33,Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923!,Curious to dive deeper
33,Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it.,Neutral
33," Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney",Curious to dive deeper
33," I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers.",Neutral
33," Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!",Curious to dive deeper
33,It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time.,Neutral
33," Wow! well see, that's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing! ",Curious to dive deeper
33,Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps.,Neutral
33,Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more!,Curious to dive deeper
33,That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!,Neutral
33," Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :)",Curious to dive deeper
33,Have a good evening!,Neutral
33,you too,Curious to dive deeper
34," I have never heard of Fanfest,",Happy
34,Hey! What is FanFest? lol,Curious to dive deeper
34," I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol",Happy
34,Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?,Neutral
34," No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military",Surprised
34,It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange.,Surprised
34,it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12,Surprised
34," after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood.",Curious to dive deeper
34,But would you categorize them as an art form?,Happy
34,Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
34," I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form",Curious to dive deeper
34," It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.",Neutral
34," Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well",Curious to dive deeper
34,Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?,Neutral
34," I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson?",Curious to dive deeper
34," Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember.",Curious to dive deeper
34," I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.",Happy
34," Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha ",Neutral
34,maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe,Surprised
34,Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol,Neutral
34,Thank you for your time but I must go now,Surprised
34,Have a good day! Thanks.,Neutral
34,bye,Surprised
34,bye!,Neutral
35,Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance?,Curious to dive deeper
35," No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn't catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there.",Surprised
35," No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL",Neutral
35," Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they're so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don't play that many these days. What about you? I'm just glad that I didn't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal",Surprised
35," Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play?",Curious to dive deeper
35,LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha,Surprised
35," I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.",Curious to dive deeper
35," Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks",Surprised
35," Wow, I'm surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though.",Curious to dive deeper
35,Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL,Happy
35," I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things.",Curious to dive deeper
35," I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry",Surprised
35,Stephen Fry from Top Gear?,Curious to dive deeper
35," I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?",Curious to dive deeper
35," I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Haha yes I can do that. It's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I've never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol",Surprised
35," Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
35," No I've never seen one actually. It's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you're not retiring on that money",Surprised
35," Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun",Happy
36," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
36,Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?,Neutral
36,A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it?,Curious to dive deeper
36," I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.",Curious to dive deeper
36," I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it.",Surprised
36," Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.",Neutral
36,Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too!,Surprised
36,Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!,Neutral
36,I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!,Fearful
36," Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that.",Neutral
36,I don't either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it.,Surprised
36,That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens.,Neutral
36,I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers!,Surprised
36,That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.,Neutral
36,There's a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936?,Curious to dive deeper
36," Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more.",Curious to dive deeper
36,They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks!,Curious to dive deeper
36,I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy,Neutral
36,Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty.,Surprised
36," Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a ""biohazard""",Neutral
36,Agreed! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
37," hey there, do you go out and vote during elections?",Curious to dive deeper
37," Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
37,me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens?,Surprised
37,I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,Curious to dive deeper
37,I wonder how that would work today though.,Curious to dive deeper
37," Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows. ",Curious to dive deeper
37,yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot.,Surprised
37,Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year.,Curious to dive deeper
37,I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote,Surprised
37," Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!",Curious to dive deeper
37,yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best.,Surprised
37,That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time?,Curious to dive deeper
37,hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates,Surprised
37," Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance. ",Curious to dive deeper
37,did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012,Surprised
37," No I didn't hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that? ",Curious to dive deeper
37," maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue?",Surprised
37," No I don't, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
37,It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago.,Curious to dive deeper
37," Really, wow I am really bad at politics I guess.  ",Surprised
37,I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
38,Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten,Curious to dive deeper
38," It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational!",Surprised
38," Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius",Curious to dive deeper
38," There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")!",Surprised
38," Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems?",Curious to dive deeper
38," I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?",Curious to dive deeper
38," Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid",Curious to dive deeper
38,Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially.,Surprised
38," I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,",Curious to dive deeper
38,That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!,Disgusted
38," That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero",Curious to dive deeper
38," Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.",Surprised
38," I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.",Curious to dive deeper
38," Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all!",Neutral
38," Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
38," It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days.",Fearful
38," I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.",Curious to dive deeper
38," Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point.",Neutral
38," I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, ",Curious to dive deeper
38," Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of ""computer"" that was though.",Neutral
38," I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech",Curious to dive deeper
39,Do you like to use computers?,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water.,Curious to dive deeper
39," Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water. ",Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty.,Curious to dive deeper
39," Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone?",Curious to dive deeper
39,I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!,Curious to dive deeper
39," That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? ",Curious to dive deeper
39,I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!,Curious to dive deeper
39,I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?,Curious to dive deeper
39,I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks.,Surprised
39," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible? ",Curious to dive deeper
39,Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.,Curious to dive deeper
39,I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram.,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts.,Curious to dive deeper
39,I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers?,Curious to dive deeper
39,I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction.,Curious to dive deeper
39,That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki?,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early.,Curious to dive deeper
39,Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
39,A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed. Nice talking to you too!,Curious to dive deeper
39,Nice chatting with you too!,Happy
40,Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times.,Curious to dive deeper
40," Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?",Neutral
40,I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.,Curious to dive deeper
40,I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related.,Neutral
40," Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy.",Curious to dive deeper
40," I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?",Neutral
40,I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!,Neutral
40," that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.",Neutral
40,Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.,Curious to dive deeper
40," He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.",Neutral
40,Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal.,Curious to dive deeper
40," Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. ",Neutral
40," That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?",Happy
40,I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world.,Neutral
40,That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from.,Curious to dive deeper
40," the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's. ",Neutral
40,Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.,Surprised
40," Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.",Neutral
40,Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon.,Neutral
40," What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!",Neutral
40,Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon.,Curious to dive deeper
41," Hello there, do you use Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas. ",Curious to dive deeper
41," Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post?",Curious to dive deeper
41,No I didn't know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for?,Curious to dive deeper
41," No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.,Curious to dive deeper
41," Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body. ",Curious to dive deeper
41," most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time!",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters?",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well.,Curious to dive deeper
41," every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side.",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other.,Curious to dive deeper
41,Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
41," Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
42," Hello friend, Do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
42,I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down?,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today? ",Curious to dive deeper
42,That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today.,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses.",Curious to dive deeper
42,I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating.,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",Curious to dive deeper
42,What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays?,Neutral
42," Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark.",Curious to dive deeper
42," I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body.",Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees.",Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.,Curious to dive deeper
42," No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too?",Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.,Neutral
42,I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.,Curious to dive deeper
42,I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?,Happy
42," Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ?,Neutral
42," No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though.",Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know. I don't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could've been used better elsewhere.,Curious to dive deeper
42," That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
43,Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
43," Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do!",Curious to dive deeper
43," I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. ",Neutral
43," Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet.",Curious to dive deeper
43," That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. ",Neutral
43," Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure.",Surprised
43," Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.",Surprised
43," I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it ""a biohazard"". What in the world could that mean?",Neutral
43," Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary!",Fearful
43,Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?!,Surprised
43," Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes!",Fearful
43," I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private!",Happy
43,Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you!,Fearful
43," How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. ",Neutral
43,That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram!,Surprised
43," Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. ",Neutral
43," Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races.",Surprised
43," Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. ",Happy
43,Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!,Happy
44,Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member?,Curious to dive deeper
44," Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!",Happy
44,It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS.,Happy
44," Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95?",Curious to dive deeper
44,If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn't realize they own IMDB as well!,Surprised
44," I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg!",Surprised
44,I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!,Surprised
44," Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can't ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended.",Surprised
44,Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school!,Curious to dive deeper
44," Oh really, Wow! Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, after riding all those horses in the movies?",Surprised
44,You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead!,Surprised
44," Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!",Neutral
44,Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn't know they could be trained like dogs to bark!,Surprised
44,I didn't know that either. I would like to hear that. I will have to look that up!,Surprised
44,They already sound a lot smarter than me haha. I always wondered why dalmatians were used at firehouses.,Surprised
44," I know, isn't it good they helped calm and protect the  horses back then. Aren't Lipizzaner horses beautiful!!",Curious to dive deeper
44,Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don't know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin!,Surprised
44," Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances!",Happy
44,I would love to see them in real life! I'm good with sharks though although I just snorkeled with some last month!,Curious to dive deeper
44," Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!!",Happy
44,They really are! Well it was nice chatting with you have a good night!,Surprised
45," Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there? ",Curious to dive deeper
45," Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters!",Curious to dive deeper
45," That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in. ",Fearful
45,They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer,Happy
45," I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York!",Curious to dive deeper
45," Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft",Happy
45," Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world! ",Happy
45," An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much!",Curious to dive deeper
45,It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift.,Happy
45,that is a lot!,Happy
45," And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so!",Surprised
45,We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!!,Happy
45," Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday!",Surprised
45,that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore?,Surprised
45," That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them!",Curious to dive deeper
45," that is good! Hey, do you like animals?",Happy
45," I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man's best friend.",Curious to dive deeper
45," Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named ""white Shark cafe"". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!",Happy
45," Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body. ",Sad
45," We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!",Happy
45," That's probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature's perfect killer!",Curious to dive deeper
45,Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!!,Happy
46,Good morning.,Neutral
46,good morning,Neutral
46,Do you keep up with the election?,Curious to dive deeper
46," yeah, but moderately.  You?",Neutral
46," yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.",Neutral
46,the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election,Neutral
46,Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time.,Neutral
46,I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state's governor?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think state senator. DId you know there hasn't been a president that wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853,Curious to dive deeper
46,Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.?,Curious to dive deeper
46,Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?,Curious to dive deeper
46," I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name",Neutral
46,Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election.,Neutral
46," It is weird, but true",Surprised
46," The Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a California governor.",Neutral
46,There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics.,Curious to dive deeper
46,Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S,Neutral
46," I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you",Surprised
46,You too. I do not think its in effect though.,Neutral
47,hi are you a republican?,Curious to dive deeper
47,No I am not. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
47," No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.",Curious to dive deeper
47," I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election",Curious to dive deeper
47," I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years!",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!",Curious to dive deeper
47," If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, and he would take Trump down.",Curious to dive deeper
47," I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.",Sad
47," Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time.",Surprised
47,For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system,Curious to dive deeper
47," Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times!",Curious to dive deeper
47," yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care.",Curious to dive deeper
47," for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!",Surprised
47," Yeah same to you, good chat.",Curious to dive deeper
47,bye!,Curious to dive deeper
48," Hello, do you follow politics much?",Curious to dive deeper
48," Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? ",Curious to dive deeper
48,Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat,Curious to dive deeper
48," Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that",Curious to dive deeper
48," Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride?",Curious to dive deeper
48," Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo",Curious to dive deeper
48,Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?,Curious to dive deeper
48," Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess",Curious to dive deeper
48," Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that",Curious to dive deeper
48," Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though",Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence?,Curious to dive deeper
48,Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for?,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day,Curious to dive deeper
48," But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day",Curious to dive deeper
48,Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw,Curious to dive deeper
48," In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment",Curious to dive deeper
48," Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII",Curious to dive deeper
48,Must have been tough being the only guy.,Happy
49,The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?,Curious to dive deeper
49,Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times.,Neutral
49," Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though",Curious to dive deeper
49,That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead.,Neutral
49," I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,",Happy
49,Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know.,Neutral
49," So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000",Curious to dive deeper
49,That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember.,Neutral
49," It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont",Curious to dive deeper
49," Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%",Neutral
49," And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat",Curious to dive deeper
49,So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol,Neutral
49," We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these''",Curious to dive deeper
49,They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now.,Neutral
49," They do, seems like the best option at times lol",Curious to dive deeper
49,It really does.,Neutral
49,I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day,Curious to dive deeper
49,It really would1,Neutral
49," He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy",Curious to dive deeper
49," He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!",Neutral
49," Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot",Curious to dive deeper
50,What did you think of the last couple elections?,Curious to dive deeper
50,I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote.,Neutral
50,That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years,Curious to dive deeper
50,the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot.,Neutral
50," I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how?",Curious to dive deeper
50,i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly.,Neutral
50,yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not,Curious to dive deeper
50," it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.",Neutral
50,Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?,Curious to dive deeper
50," well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.",Neutral
50,Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right?,Curious to dive deeper
50," no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. ",Neutral
50," Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2",Curious to dive deeper
50," yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.",Neutral
50," for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor",Curious to dive deeper
50," he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.",Neutral
50,He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol,Curious to dive deeper
50," yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics.",Neutral
50," For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. ",Curious to dive deeper
50," people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.",Neutral
50,I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
