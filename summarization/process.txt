Technical Implementation Details:

Model Architecture:
- Implemented extractive summarization using NLTK for text processing
- Utilized word frequency analysis for sentence importance scoring
- Leveraged sentence position and length as additional scoring factors

Current Implementation:
- Text is split into sentences using NLTK sentence tokenizer
- Stopwords are removed and words are normalized
- Word frequencies are calculated to identify key terms
- Sentences are scored based on:
  - Presence of important words
  - Position in the text
  - Length and readability metrics
- Top scoring sentences are selected while maintaining original order

Future Enhancements:
1. Text Processing Improvements
   - Evaluate additional preprocessing techniques
   - Experiment with different scoring algorithms
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Implement sentence clustering for better diversity

2. Model Improvements
   - Explore abstractive summarization approaches
   - Integrate with transformer-based models
   - Add customizable summarization parameters
   - Implement evaluation metrics
